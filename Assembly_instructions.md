The instructions presented in the subsequent pages are for the prototype our team has created. As such there are a number of changes an individual can, and should, make based on the tools and materials available to him or her.

###Assembly Note:
The frame and base foam board were assembled using the super glue “Gorilla Glue” and clamps as shown in the below picture. You could substitute this with nails, screws, or any method to secure the materials together.

Create the bottom of the frame by creating a rectangle with two 40” lengths of wood and two 20” lengths.

Create the top of the frame in a similar manner to the bottom with the addition of the 38” 2x1. The center beam should be placed an inch or two off center, depending on the size of the cameras you have.

The next step is to attach the legs at the corners that will connect the top and bottom portions of the frame. For our configuration we secured each of the legs to the 40” section of the bottom.

To complete the frame simply secure the top section to the four legs in a similar fashion as was done with the bottom

Now that the frame is done we can attach the foam board to form the base.

Cut the strip lights (note: cut the strips in the designated locations only) into 5 strips that can fit lengthwise inside the base with an inch or two space from the wood sides.

Ensuring the strip with the power cord connection is at the edge, lay the strips on the base at approximately equal distances but do not yet attach them. This doesn’t need to be exact and can be done by eye. Starting with the strirp with the power connection, clamp on one of the strip light connectors making sure you correctly connect the positive and negative clamps to the positive and negative connections on the strip. Next attach the still free end of the connector to the adjacent strip of lights in the same way (Note: if the positive and negative connectors of the connector seem to be opposite that of the light strip you likely have the second strip facing the wrong direction, simply flip it and you’ll find the connections in the correct spot). Repeat until all of the lights are wired in a chain and attached to the board. You’ll want to now test the lights to ensure each strip is correctly connected.

Cut a notch into the wood frame so the lights power cord does not get squished by the acrylic.

Now we must just the corners out of our piece of acrylic. You’ll want to cut each corner 2” on the long side and 1” on the short side. This can be done easily with a hand saw or dremel.

Time to place the acrylic into the scanner. As it has the same dimensions as the frame itself you will need to move it into the frame at an angle (from corner to corner) and rotate it down into place. Make sure the wires from the light connectors under the acrylic and not pinched between the acrylic and the wood. We chose not to permanently attach the acrylic to retain easy access to lights, allow the acrylic to be replaced easily if needed, and a general lack of reason to secure it in place as its weight holds it down well.
