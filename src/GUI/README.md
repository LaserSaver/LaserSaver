This will be a guide to help you know 
which controller is in charge of which model 
and where to put your model class execution.

I am only in charge of controller code that modifies 
the view like we discussed. All my model classes are 
mock ups for processing.

scale/stitchModel Idk - validationScaleController__
skewModel - skewController__
contours/export/stitchModel Idk - contoursController__
